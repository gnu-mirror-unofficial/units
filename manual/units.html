<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview of <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp></h2>

<!-- end noman -->
<!-- ifman -->
<!-- end ifman -->
<p>The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program converts quantities expressed in various
systems of measurement to their equivalents in other systems of
measurement.  Like many similar programs, it can handle multiplicative
scale changes. It can also handle nonlinear conversions such as
Fahrenheit to
<!-- man Celsius. -->
<!-- noman -->
Celsius.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
See <a href="#Temperature-Conversions">Temperature Conversions</a>. 
<!-- end noman -->
<!-- man See the examples below. -->
The program can also perform conversions from and to sums of
units, such as converting between meters and feet plus inches.

   <p>Beyond simple unit conversions, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> can be used as a
general-purpose scientific calculator that keeps track of units in its
calculations.  You can form arbitrary complex mathematical expressions
of dimensions including sums, products, quotients, powers, and even roots
of dimensions.  Thus you can ensure accuracy and dimensional consistency
when working with long expressions that involve many different units
that may combine in complex ways.

   <p>The units are defined in an external data file.  You can use the
extensive data file that comes with this program, or you can
provide your own data file to suit your needs.  You can also use your
own data file to supplement the standard data file.

   <p>Basic
operation is simple: you enter the units that you want to convert
<em>from</em> and the units that you want to convert <em>to</em>. 
You can use the program interactively with prompts, or you can use it
from the command line.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Interacting with <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp></h2>

<p><a name="index-interactive-use-1"></a>
To invoke units for interactive use, type <kbd>units</kbd> at your shell
prompt.  The program will print something like this:

<pre class="example">     Currency exchange rates from 04/23/12
     2516 units, 85 prefixes, 65 nonlinear units
     
     You have:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You have:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt, type the quantity and units that
you are converting <em>from</em>.  For example, if you want to convert ten
meters to feet, type <kbd>10 meters</kbd>.  Next, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will print
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You should type the units you want to convert
<em>to</em>.  To convert to feet, you would type <kbd>feet</kbd>.  If
the <samp><span class="command">readline</span></samp> library was compiled in then the tab key can be
used to complete unit names. See <a href="#Readline-Support">Readline Support</a>, for more
information about <samp><span class="command">readline</span></samp>.  To quit the program press
Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D under Unix.  Under Windows press Ctrl-Z.

   <p>The answer will be displayed in two ways.  The first line of output,
which is marked with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate multiplication,
gives the result of the conversion you have asked for.  The second line
of output, which is marked with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate division, gives
the inverse of the conversion factor.  If you convert 10 meters to feet,
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will print

<pre class="example">         * 32.808399
         / 0.03048
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet. 
The second number gives the conversion in the opposite direction. 
In this case, it tells you that 1 foot is equal to about
0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10 meters. 
It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about 0.03.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program prints the inverse because sometimes it is a
more convenient number.  In the example above, for example, the inverse
value is an exact conversion: a foot is exactly 0.03048 dekameters. 
But the number given the other direction is inexact.

   <p>If you convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:

<pre class="example">     You have: grains
     You want: pounds
             * 0.00014285714
             / 7000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">&gt;From the second line of the output you can immediately see that a grain
is equal to a seven thousandth of a pound.  This is not so obvious from
the first line of the output. 
If you find  the output format  confusing, try using the
<samp><span class="option">--verbose</span></samp> option:
<a name="index-verbose-output-2"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: grain
     You want: aeginamina
             grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
             grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you request a conversion between units that measure reciprocal
dimensions, then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will display the conversion results with an extra
note indicating that reciprocal conversion has been done:
<a name="index-reciprocal-conversion-3"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: 6 ohms
     You want: siemens
             reciprocal conversion
             * 0.16666667
             / 6
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the <samp><span class="option">--strict</span></samp> option. 
As usual, use
the <samp><span class="option">--verbose</span></samp> option to get more comprehensible output:
<a name="index-verbose-output-4"></a><a name="index-strict-conversion-5"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: tex
     You want: typp
             reciprocal conversion
             1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
             1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
     
     You have: 20 mph
     You want: sec/mile
             reciprocal conversion
             1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
             1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you enter incompatible unit types, the <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program will
print a message indicating that the units are not conformable and
it will display the reduced form for each unit:
<a name="index-incompatible-units-6"></a><a name="index-non_002dconformable-units-7"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: ergs/hour
     You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
     conformability error
             2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
             2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit,
simply press &lt;Enter&gt; at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     You have: jansky
     You want:
             Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output from <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> indicates that the jansky is defined to be
equal to a fluxunit which in turn is defined to be a certain combination
of watts, meters, and hertz.  The fully reduced (and in this case
somewhat more cryptic) form appears on the far right.

   <p>Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some situations. 
These units include the radian and steradian.  These units will be
treated as equal to 1 in units conversions.  Power is equal to torque
times angular velocity.  This conversion can only be performed if the
radian is dimensionless.

<pre class="example">     You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
     You want: watts
             * 227.77742
             / 0.0043902509
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Named dimensionless units are not treated as dimensionless
in other contexts.  They cannot be used as exponents
so for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">meter^radian</span></samp>&rsquo; is not allowed. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units-8"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-to-show-conformable-units-9"></a><a name="index-conformable-units_002c-_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-to-show-10"></a>If you want a list of options you can type <kbd>?</kbd> at the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt.  The program will display a list of named
units that are conformable with the unit that you entered at
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You have:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt above.  Conformable unit
<em>combinations</em> will not appear on this list.

   <p><a name="index-help-11"></a>
Typing <kbd>help</kbd> at either prompt displays a short help message. 
You can also type <kbd>help</kbd> followed by a unit name.  This will
invoke a pager on the units data base at the point where that unit
is defined.  You can read the definition and comments that may
give more details or historical information about the unit.  (You
can generally quit out of the page by pressing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>Typing <kbd>search</kbd> <var>text</var> will display a list of all of the units
whose names contain <var>text</var> as a substring along with their definitions. 
This may help in the case where you aren't sure of the right unit name.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Using <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> Non-Interactively</h2>

<p><a name="index-command_002dline-unit-conversion-12"></a><a name="index-non_002dinteractive-unit-conversion-13"></a>
The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program can perform units conversions non-interactively
from the command line.  To do this, type the command, type the original
unit expression, and type the new units you want.  If a units
expression contains non-alphanumeric characters, you may need to protect
it from interpretation by the shell using single or double quote
characters.

   <p>If you type

<pre class="example">     units "2 liters" quarts
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will print

<pre class="example">         * 2.1133764
         / 0.47317647
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then exit. 
The output tells you that 2 liters is about 2.1 quarts, or alternatively that
a quart is about 0.47 times 2 liters.

   <p>If the conversion is successful, then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will return success (zero)
to the calling environment.  If you enter  non-conformable
units then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will print a message giving the reduced form of
each unit and it will return failure (nonzero) to the calling environment.

   <p>When you invoke <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> with only one argument, it will print out
the definition of the specified unit.  It will return failure if the
unit is not defined and success if the unit is defined.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Unit Definitions</h2>

<p><a name="index-unit-definitions-14"></a>
The conversion information is read from a units data file that
is called <samp><span class="file">definitions.units</span></samp> and is usually located in
the <samp><span class="file">/usr/share/units</span></samp> directory. 
If you invoke <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> with the <samp><span class="option">-V</span></samp> option, it will print
the location of this file. 
The default
file includes definitions for all familiar units, abbreviations and
metric prefixes.  It also includes many obscure or archaic units.

   <p>Many constants of nature are defined, including these:

<pre class="example">     pi          <span class="roman">ratio of circumference to diameter</span>
     c           <span class="roman">speed of light</span>
     e           <span class="roman">charge on an electron</span>
     force       <span class="roman">acceleration of gravity</span>
     mole        <span class="roman">Avogadro's number</span>
     water       <span class="roman">pressure per unit height of water</span>
     Hg          <span class="roman">pressure per unit height of mercury</span>
     au          <span class="roman">astronomical unit</span>
     k           <span class="roman">Boltzman's constant</span>
     mu0         <span class="roman">permeability of vacuum</span>
     epsilon0    <span class="roman">permittivity of vacuum</span>
     G           <span class="roman">Gravitational constant</span>
     mach        <span class="roman">speed of sound</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The standard data file includes atomic masses for all of the elements
and numerous other constants.  Also included are the densities of
various ingredients used in baking so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 cups flour_sifted</span></samp>&rsquo;
can be converted to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">grams</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is not an exhaustive list. 
Consult the units data file to see the complete list, or to see the
definitions that are used.

   <p><a name="index-measure_002c-Imperial-15"></a><a name="index-Imperial-measure-16"></a><a name="index-British-Imperial-measure-17"></a>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pound</span></samp>&rsquo; is a unit of mass.  To get force, multiply by the
force conversion unit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">force</span></samp>&rsquo; or use the shorthand &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lbf</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; is already taken as the standard abbreviation for
the gram.)  The unit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ounce</span></samp>&rsquo; is also a unit of mass.  The fluid
ounce is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fluidounce</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">floz</span></samp>&rsquo;.  British capacity units that
differ from their US counterparts, such as the British Imperial gallon,
are prefixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">br</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Currency is prefixed with its country
name: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">belgiumfranc</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">britainpound</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-units_002c-lookup-method-18"></a>
When searching for a unit, if the specified string does not appear
exactly as a unit name, then the <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program will try to
remove a trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">es</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Next units will replace a
trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ies</span></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If that fails,
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will check for a prefix.  The database includes all
of the standard metric prefixes.  Only one prefix is permitted per
unit, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">micromicrofarad</span></samp>&rsquo; will fail.  However, prefixes can
appear alone with no unit following them, so
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">micro*microfarad</span></samp>&rsquo; will work, as will &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">micro microfarad</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-prefixes-19"></a>
To find out which units and prefixes are available, read the standard
units data file, which is extensively annotated.

<!-- @node English Customary Units -->
<h3 class="section">4.1 English Customary Units</h3>

<p><a name="index-volume-measure_002c-English-customary-20"></a>English customary units differ in various ways in different
regions.  In Britain a complex system of volume measurements featured
different gallons for different materials such as a wine gallon and
ale gallon that different by twenty percent.  This complexity was
swept away in 1824 by a reform that created an entirely new gallon,
the British Imperial gallon defined as the volume occupied by ten
pounds of water.  Meanwhile in the USA the gallon is derived from the
1707 Winchester wine gallon, which is 231 cubic inches.  These gallons
differ by about twenty percent.  By default if <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> runs in
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB</span></samp>&rsquo; locale you will get the British volume measures.  If
it runs in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_US</span></samp>&rsquo; locale you will get the US volume
measures.  In other locales the default values are the US
definitions.  If you wish to force different definitions then set the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">UNITS_ENGLISH</span></samp> to either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">US</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GB</span></samp>&rsquo; to set the desired definitions independent of the locale.

   <p><a name="index-length-measure_002c-English-customary-21"></a><a name="index-length-measure_002c-UK-22"></a><a name="index-survey-measure_002c-US-23"></a><a name="index-US-survey-measure-24"></a><a name="index-survey-mile_002c-US-25"></a><a name="index-US-survey-foot-26"></a><a name="index-State-Plane-Coordinate-System_002c-US-27"></a><a name="index-US-State-Plane-Coordinate-System-28"></a><a name="index-survey-foot_002c-US-29"></a><a name="index-US-survey-mile-30"></a><a name="index-mile_002c-international-31"></a><a name="index-international-mile-32"></a><a name="index-yard_002c-international-33"></a><a name="index-international-yard-34"></a>Before 1959, the value of a yard (and other units of measure defined in
terms of it) differed slightly among English-speaking countries.  In
1959, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United
States, and South Africa adopted the Canadian value of 1&nbsp;yard =
0.9144&nbsp;m (exactly), which was approximately halfway between the
values used by the UK and the US; it had the additional advantage of
making 1&nbsp;inch = 2.54&nbsp;cm (exactly).  This new standard was
termed the <dfn>International Yard</dfn>.  Australia, Canada, and the UK
then defined all customary lengths in terms of the International Yard
(Australia did not define the furlong or rod); because many US land
surveys were in terms of the pre-1959 units, the US continued to define
customary surveyors' units (furlong, chain, rod, and link) in terms of
the previous value for the foot, which was termed the
<dfn>US survey foot</dfn>.  The US defined a <dfn>US survey mile</dfn> as 5280 US
survey feet, and defined a <dfn>statute mile</dfn> as a US survey mile.  The
US values for these units differ from the international values by about
2&nbsp;ppm.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program uses the international values for these
units; the US values can be obtained by using either the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">US</span></samp>&rsquo; or
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">survey</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix.  In either case, the simple familiar
relationships among the units are maintained, e.g., 1 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">furlong</span></samp>&rsquo; =
660 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ft</span></samp>&rsquo;, and 1 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USfurlong</span></samp>&rsquo; = 660 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USft</span></samp>&rsquo;, though the
metric equivalents differ slightly between the two cases. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">US</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">survey</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix can also be used to
obtain the US survey mile and the value of the US yard prior to 1959,
e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USmile</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">surveymile</span></samp>&rsquo; (but <em>not</em>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USsurveymile</span></samp>&rsquo;).  To get the US value of the statute mile, use
either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USstatutemile</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USmile</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Except for distances that extend over hundreds of miles (such as in the
US State Plane Coordinate System), the differences in the miles are
usually insignificant:

<pre class="example">     You have: 100 surveymile - 100 mile
     You want: inch
             * 12.672025
             / 0.078913984
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The pre-1959 UK values for these units can be obtained with the prefix
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">UK</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>In the US, the acre is officially defined in terms of the US survey
foot, but <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> uses a definition based on the international
foot.  If you want the official US acre use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USacre</span></samp>&rsquo; and
similarly use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USacrefoot</span></samp>&rsquo; for the official US version of that
unit.  The difference between these units is about 4 parts per million.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Operators</h3>

<p><a name="index-operators-36"></a>
You can enter more complicated units by combining units
with operations
such as powers, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and
parentheses for grouping. 
You can use the customary symbols for these operators when
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> is invoked with its default options.  Additionally,
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> supports some extensions, including high
priority multiplication using a
space, and a high priority numerical
 division operator (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;) that can simplify
some expressions.

   <p>Powers of units can be specified using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; character as shown in
the following example, or by simple concatenation of a unit and its
exponent: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cm3</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cm^3</span></samp>&rsquo;;
if the exponent is more than one digit, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is required. 
An
exponent like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2^3^2</span></samp>&rsquo; is evaluated right to left as usual. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;
operator has the second highest precedence.  You can also use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">**</span></samp>&rsquo; as
an exponent operator. 
<a name="index-powers-37"></a><a name="index-exponent-operator-38"></a><a name="index-operator_002c-caret-_0028_0040samp_007b_005e_007d_0029-39"></a><a name="index-operator_002c-_0028_0040samp_007b_002a_002a_007d_0029-40"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002a_002a_007d-operator-41"></a><a name="index-parentheses-42"></a>

<pre class="example">     You have: cm^3
     You want: gallons
             * 0.00026417205

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You multiply units using a space or an asterisk (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
The example above shows both forms.  You can divide units using the
slash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;) or with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">per</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="example">     You have: furlongs per fortnight
     You want: m/s
             * 0.00016630986
             / 6012.8727
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-operator-precedence-58"></a><a name="index-parentheses-59"></a><a name="index-prefixes-and-exponents-60"></a>When a unit includes a prefix, exponent operators apply to the
combination, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">centimeter^3</span></samp>&rsquo; gives cubic centimeters.  If you separate
the prefix from the unit with any multiplication operator, such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">centi meter^3</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the prefix is treated as a separate unit, so
the exponent does not apply.  The second example would be a hundredth
of a cubic meter, not a centimeter.

   <p>Multiplication using a space  has a higher precedence
than division using a slash and is evaluated left to right;
in effect, the first &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; character marks the beginning of the
denominator of a unit expression. 
This makes it simple to
enter a quotient with several terms in the denominator: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">W / m^2 Hz</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If you multiply with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; then you must group the terms in the
denominator with parentheses: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">W / (m^2 * Hz)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The higher precedence of the space operator may not always be advantageous. 
For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m/s s/day</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m / s s day</span></samp>&rsquo; and has dimensions of length per time cubed. 
Similarly, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/2 meter</span></samp>&rsquo; refers to a unit of reciprocal length
equivalent to 0.5/meter, perhaps not what you would intend if
you entered that expression. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; operator is convenient for multiplying a sequence of quotients. 
With the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; operator, the example above becomes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m/s * s/day</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is
equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m/day</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Similarly, you could write
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/2 * meter</span></samp>&rsquo; to get half a meter. 
Alternatively, parentheses can be used for grouping: you could write
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(1/2) meter</span></samp>&rsquo; to get half a meter. 
See <a href="#Complicated-Unit-Expressions">Complicated Unit Expressions</a>, for an illustration of the various
options.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program supports another option for numerical fractions. 
You can indicate division of <em>numbers</em> with the vertical bar
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;), so if you wanted half a meter you could write
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1|2 meter</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This operator has the highest precedence, so you can
write the square root of two thirds &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2|3^1|2</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You cannot use the vertical bar to indicate division of non-numerical
units (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m|s</span></samp>&rsquo; results in an error message).

Outside of the SI, it is sometimes desirable to add values of
different units.  You may also wish to use <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> as a
calculator that keeps track of units.  Sums of conformable units are written with
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; character, and differences with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; character.

   <p class="noindent">The expressions that are added or subtracted must reduce to identical
expressions in primitive units, or an error message will be displayed:

<pre class="example">     You have: 12 printerspoint - 4 heredium

     Illegal sum of non-conformable units
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-parentheses-81"></a>As usual, the precedence for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is lower than that of
the other operators. 
A fractional quantity such as 2&nbsp;1/2 cups can be given as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2+1|2) cups</span></samp>&rsquo;; the parentheses are necessary because
multiplication has higher precedence than addition.  If you omit the
parentheses, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> attempts to add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1|2 cups</span></samp>&rsquo;, and you get an error message:

<pre class="example">     You have: 2+1|2 cups
                        ^
     Illegal sum or difference of non-conformable units
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The expression could also be correctly written as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2+1/2) cups</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 1|2 cups</span></samp>&rsquo; the space is interpreted as <em>multiplication</em> so the result is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 cup</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; characters sometimes appears in exponents like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3.43e+8</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This leads to an ambiguity in an expression like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3e+2 yC</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The unit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; is a small unit of charge, so this
can be regarded as equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(3e+2) yC</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(3 e)+(2 yC)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This ambiguity is resolved by always interpreting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; as part
of an exponent if possible.

appear as many times as you like and in any order in a unit expression. 
For example, to find the volume of a box that is 2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft

<h3 class="section">5.6 Backwards Compatibility: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;</h3>

<p><a name="index-backwards-compatibility-89"></a><a name="index-compatibility-90"></a><a name="index-compatibility-with-earlier-versions-91"></a>
The original <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> assigned multiplication a higher
precedence than division using the slash.  This differs from the
usual precedence rules, which give multiplication and division equal
precedence, and can be confusing for people who think
of units as a calculator.

   <p>The star operator (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;) included in this <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program
has, by default, the same precedence as division,
and hence follows the usual precedence rules.  For backwards
compatibility you can invoke <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>
with the <samp><span class="option">--oldstar</span></samp>
option.  Then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; has a higher precedence than
division, and the same precedence as multiplication using the space.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002d_007d-as-multiplication-operator-92"></a><a name="index-operator_002c-hyphen-_0028_0040samp_007b_002d_007d_0029-as-multiplication-93"></a><a name="index-multiplication_002c-hyphen-94"></a><a name="index-hyphen-as-multiplication-operator-95"></a>
Historically, the hyphen (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;) has been used in technical
publications to indicate products of units, and the original
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program treated it as a multiplication operator. 
Because <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> provides
several other ways to obtain unit products, and because &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
subtraction operator in general algebraic expressions, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>
treats the binary &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; as a subtraction operator by default. 
For backwards compatibility use the <samp><span class="option">--product</span></samp> option, which
causes <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> to treat the binary &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; operator as a
product operator.  When &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is a multiplication operator
it has the same precedence as multiplication with a space, giving it a
higher precedence than division.

   <p>When &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is used as a unary operator it negates its operand. 
Regardless of the <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> options, if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; appears after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; or after
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; then it will act as a negation operator.  So you can always compute 20
degrees minus 12 minutes by entering &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">20 degrees + -12 arcmin</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You must use this construction when you define new units because you
cannot know what options will be in force when your definition is
processed.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Temperature Conversions</h3>

<p><a name="index-temperature-conversions-98"></a>
Conversions between temperatures are different from linear conversions
between temperature <em>increments</em>&mdash;see the example below.  The
absolute temperature conversions are handled by units starting with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">temp</span></samp>&rsquo;, and you must use functional notation. 
The temperature-increment conversions are done using units starting
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">deg</span></samp>&rsquo; and they do not require functional notation.

<pre class="example">     You have: tempF(45)
     You want: tempC
             7.2222222
     
     You have: 45 degF
     You want: degC
             * 25
             / 0.04
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Think of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF(</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; not as a function but as a notation that
indicates that <var>x</var> should have units of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF</span></samp>&rsquo; attached to
it.  See <a href="#Defining-Nonlinear-Units">Defining Nonlinear Units</a>.  The first conversion shows that if it's 45
degrees Fahrenheit outside, it's 7.2 degrees Celsius.  The second
conversion indicates that a change of 45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds
to a change of 25 degrees Celsius.  The conversion from
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF(</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; is to absolute temperature, so that

<pre class="example">     You have: tempF(45)
     You want: degR
             * 504.67
             / 0.0019814929
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">gives the same result as

<pre class="example">     You have: tempF(45)
     You want: tempR
             * 504.67
             / 0.0019814929
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">But if you convert &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF(</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">degC</span></samp>&rsquo;, the output is
probably not what you expect:

<pre class="example">     You have: tempF(45)
     You want: degC
             * 280.37222
             / 0.0035666871
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The result is the temperature in K, because &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">degC</span></samp>&rsquo; is defined as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo;, the Kelvin. For consistent results, use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">temp</span><var>X</var></samp>&rsquo; units
when converting to a temperature rather than converting a temperature
increment.

Some other examples of nonlinear units are numerous different ring
sizes and wire gauges, the grit sizes used for abrasives, the decibel
scale, shoe size, scales for the density of sugar (e.g. baume). 
The standard data file also supplies units for computing the area of a
circle and the volume of a sphere.  See the standard units data file
for more details. 
Wire gauges
with multiple zeroes are signified using negative numbers where two
zeroes is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Alternatively, you can use the synonyms &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g00</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g000</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on that are defined in the standard units data file.

You can compute the area of a circle using the nonlinear unit,

<h2 class="chapter">7 Unit Lists: Conversion to Sums of Units</h2>

<p><a name="index-sums-of-units-104"></a><a name="index-unit-lists-105"></a><a name="index-units_002c-sums-of-106"></a>
Outside of the SI, it is sometimes desirable to convert a single
unit to a sum of units&mdash;for example, feet to feet plus inches. 
The conversion <em>from</em> sums of units was described in
<a href="#Sums-and-Differences-of-Units">Sums and Differences of Units</a>, and is a simple matter of adding
the units with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; sign:

<pre class="example">     You have: 12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in
     You want: ft
             * 12.28125
             / 0.081424936
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Although you can similarly write a sum of units to convert <em>to</em>,
the result will not be the conversion to the units in the sum, but
rather the conversion to the particular sum that you have entered:

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28125 ft
     You want: ft + in + 1|8 in
             * 11.228571
             / 0.089058524
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The unit expression given at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt is equivalent
to asking for conversion to multiples of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 ft + 1 in + 1|8 in</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which is 1.09375 ft, so the conversion in the previous example is
equivalent to

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28125 ft
     You want: 1.09375 ft
             * 11.228571
             / 0.089058524
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In converting to a sum of units like miles, feet and inches, you
typically want the largest integral value for the first unit, followed
by the largest integral value for the next, and the remainder converted
to the last unit. 
You can do this conversion easily with <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> using a special
syntax for lists of units.  You must list the desired units in order
from largest to smallest, separated by the semicolon (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;)
character:

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28125 ft
     You want: ft;in;1|8 in
             12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The conversion always gives integer coefficients on the units in the
list, except possibly the last unit when the conversion is not exact:

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28126 ft
     You want: ft;in;1|8 in
             12 ft + 3 in + 3.00096 * 1|8 in
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The order in which you list the units is important:

<pre class="example">     You have: 3 kg
     You want: oz;lb
             105 oz + 0.051367866 lb
     
     You have: 3 kg
     You want: lb;oz
             6 lb + 9.8218858 oz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Listing ounces before pounds produces a technically correct result,
but not a very useful one.  You must list the units in descending
order of size in order to get the most useful result.

   <p>Ending a unit list with the separator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;
has the same effect as repeating the last
unit on the list, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ft;in;1|8 in;</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ft;in;1|8 in;1|8 in</span></samp>&rsquo;.  With the example above, this gives

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28126 ft
     You want: ft;in;1|8 in;
             12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in + 0.00096 * 1|8 in
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in effect separating the integer and fractional parts of the
coefficient for the last unit.  If you instead
prefer to round the last coefficient to an integer
you can do this with the <samp><span class="option">--round</span></samp> (<samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp>) option. 
With the previous example, the result is

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28126 ft
     You want: ft;in;1|8 in
             12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in (rounded down to nearest 1|8 in)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you use the <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option, repeating the last unit on the
list has no effect (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ft;in;1|8 in;1|8 in</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ft;in;1|8 in</span></samp>&rsquo;), and hence neither does ending a list with a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  With a single unit and the <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option, a terminal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;
<em>does</em> have an effect: it causes <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> to treat the
single unit as a list and produce a rounded value for the single unit. 
Without the extra &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;, the <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option has no effect on
single unit conversions.  This example shows the ouput using the
<samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option:

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28126 ft
     You want: in
             * 147.37512
             / 0.0067854058
     
     You have: 12.28126 ft
     You want: in;
             147 in (rounded down to nearest in)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Each unit that appears in the list must be conformable with the first
unit on the list, and of course the listed units must also
be comformable with the <em>You have</em> unit that you enter.

<pre class="example">     You have: meter
     You want: ft;kg
                  ^
     conformability error
             ft = 0.3048 m
             kg = 1 kg
     
     You have: meter
     You want: lb;oz
     conformability error
             1 m
             0.45359237 kg
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the first case, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> reports the disagreement between
units appearing on the list.  In the second case, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>
reports disagreement between the unit you entered and the desired
conversion.  This conformability error is based on the first
unit on the unit list.

   <p>Other common candidates for conversion to sums of units are
angles and time:

<pre class="example">     You have: 23.437754 deg
     You want; deg;arcmin;arcsec
         23 deg + 26 arcmin + 15.9144 arcsec
     
         You have: 7.2319 hr
         You want: hr;min;sec
             7 hr + 13 min + 54.84 sec
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In North America, recipes for cooking typically measure ingredients by
volume, and use units that are not always convenient multiples of each
other.  Suppose that you have a recipe for 6 and you wish to make a
portion for 1.  If the recipe calls for 2&nbsp;1/2 cups of an
ingredient, you might wish to know the measurements in terms of
measuring devices you have available, you could use <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> and
enter

<pre class="example">     You have: (2+1|2) cup / 6
     You want: cup;1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup;tbsp;tsp;1|2 tsp;1|4 tsp
             1|3 cup + 1 tbsp + 1 tsp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">By default, if a unit in a list begins with fraction of the form
1|<var>x</var> and its multiplier is an integer, the fraction is given as
the product of the multiplier and the numerator; for example,

<pre class="example">     You have: 12.28125 ft
     You want: ft;in;1|8 in;
             12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In many cases, such as the example above, this is what is wanted, but
sometimes it is not.  For example, a cooking recipe for 6 might call
for 5&nbsp;1/4 cup of an ingredient, but you want a portion for 2, and
your 1-cup measure is not available; you might try

<pre class="example">     You have: (5+1|4) cup / 3
     You want: 1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup
             3|2 cup + 1|4 cup
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This result might be fine for a baker who has a 1&nbsp;1/2-cup measure
(and recognizes the equivalence), but it may not be as useful to
someone with more limited set of measures, who does want to do
additional calculations, and only wants to know &ldquo;How many 1/2-cup
measures to I need to add?&rdquo;  After all, that's what was actually
asked.  With the <samp><span class="option">--show-factor</span></samp> option, the factor will not be
combined with a unity numerator, so that you get

<pre class="example">     You have: (5+1|4) cup / 3
     You want: 1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup
             3 * 1|2 cup + 1|4 cup
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A user-specified fractional unit with a numerator other than 1 is never
overridden, however&mdash;if a unit list specifies &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3|4 cup;1|2 cup</span></samp>&rsquo;,
a result equivalent to 1&nbsp;1/2 cups will always be shown as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 * 3|4 cup</span></samp>&rsquo; whether or not the <samp><span class="option">--show-factor</span></samp> option is
given.

   <p>Some applications for unit lists may be less obvious.  Suppose that you
have a postal scale and wish to ensure that it's accurate at 1&nbsp;oz,
but have only metric calibration weights.  You might try

<pre class="example">     You have: 1 oz
     You want: 100 g;50 g; 20 g;10 g;5 g;2 g;1 g;
             20 g + 5 g + 2 g + 1 g + 0.34952312 * 1 g
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You might then place one each of the 20&nbsp;g, 5&nbsp;g, 2&nbsp;g, and
1&nbsp;g weights on the scale and hope that it indicates close to

<pre class="example">     You have: 20 g + 5 g + 2 g + 1 g
     You want: oz;
             0.98767093 oz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">oz</span></samp>&rsquo; forces a one-line display that includes
the unit; here the integer part of the result is zero, so it is not
displayed.

   <p>A unit list such as

<pre class="example">     cup;1|2&nbsp;cup;1|3&nbsp;cup;1|4&nbsp;cup;tbsp;tsp;1|2&nbsp;tsp;1|4&nbsp;tsp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">can be tedious to enter.  The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program provides shorthand names
for some common combinations:

<pre class="example">     hms         <span class="roman">hours, minutes, seconds</span>
     dms         <span class="roman">angle: degrees, minutes, seconds</span>
     time        <span class="roman">years, days, hours, minutes and seconds</span>
     usvol       <span class="roman">US cooking volume: cups and smaller</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Using these shorthands, or <dfn>unit list aliases</dfn>,
you can do the following conversions:

<pre class="example">     You have: anomalisticyear
     You want: time
             1 year + 25 min + 3.4653216 sec
     You have: 1|6 cup
     You want: usvol
             2 tbsp + 2 tsp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You cannot combine a unit list alias with other units: it must appear
alone at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt.

   <p>You can display the definition of a unit list by pressing &lt;Enter&gt; at the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You have:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt:

<pre class="example">     You have: dms
             Definition: unit list, deg;arcmin;arcsec
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you specify compact output with <samp><span class="option">--compact</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">--terse</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> and perform conversion to a unit list,

<h2 class="chapter">8 Invoking <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp></h2>

<p><a name="index-invoking-units-107"></a><a name="index-command_002dline-options-108"></a>
You invoke <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> like this:

<pre class="example">     units [<var>options</var>] [<var>from-unit</var> [<var>to-unit</var>]]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the <var>from-unit</var> and <var>to-unit</var> are omitted, then the program
will use interactive prompts to determine which conversions to perform. 
See <a href="#Interactive-Use">Interactive Use</a>. 
If both <var>from-unit</var> and <var>to-unit</var> are given, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will
print the result of that single conversion and then exit. 
If only <var>from-unit</var> appears on the command line, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will
display the definition of that unit and exit. 
Units specified on the command line may need
to be quoted to protect them from shell interpretation and to group
them into two arguments.  See <a href="#Command-Line-Use">Command Line Use</a>.

   <p>The following options allow you to read in an alternative units file,
check your units file, or change the output format:

to primitive units.  Print a list of all units that
cannot be reduced.  Also display some other diagnostics about
suspicious definitions in the units data file.  Only definitions active
in the current locale are checked.  You should always run
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> with this option after modifying a units data file.

cannot be reduced.  But to help find unit  definitions that cause
endless loops,
it lists the units as they are checked. 
If <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> hangs, then the last unit to be printed has a bad
definition.  Only definitions active in the current locale are checked.

<p><a name="index-additional-units-data-files-141"></a><a name="index-data-files_002c-additional-142"></a><a name="index-units-data-files_002c-additional-143"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0021include_007d-144"></a><a name="index-command_002c-_0040samp_007b_0021include_007d-145"></a><a name="index-including-additional-units-data-files-146"></a>
The units and prefixes that <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> can convert are
defined in the units
data file, typically <samp><span class="file">/usr/share/units/definitions.units</span></samp>. 
Although you can extend or modify this
data file if you have appropriate user privileges, it's usually better
to put extensions in separate files so that the definitions will be
preserved when you update <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>.

   <p>You can include additional data files in the units database using
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!include</span></samp>&rsquo; command in the standard units data file. For
example

<pre class="example">     !include    /usr/local/share/units/local.units
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">might be appropriate for a site-wide supplemental data file. 
The location of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!include</span></samp>&rsquo; statement in the standard units
data file is important; later definitions replace earlier ones,
so any definitions in an included file will override definitions before
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!include</span></samp>&rsquo; statement in the standard units data file. 
With normal invocation, no warning is given about redefinitions; to
ensure that you don't have an unintended redefinition, run
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">units&nbsp;-c</span></samp>&rsquo; after making changes to any units data file.

   <p><a name="index-personal-units-data-file-147"></a><a name="index-units-data-file_002c-personal-148"></a>
If you want to add your own units in addition to or in place of
standard or site-wide supplemental units data files, you can include
them in the <samp><span class="file">.units</span></samp> file in your home directory.  If this
file exists it is read after the standard units data file, so that any
definitions in this file will replace definitions of the same units in
the standard data file or in files included from the standard data
file.  This file will not be read if any units files are specified on
the command line.  (Under Windows the personal units file is
named <samp><span class="file">unitdef.units</span></samp>.)

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program first tries to determine your home
directory from the <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> environment variable.  On systems running
Microsoft Windows, if <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> does not exist, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>
attempts to find your home directory from <samp><span class="env">HOMEDRIVE</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="env">HOMEPATH</span></samp>.  Running <samp><span class="command">units -V</span></samp> will display the location
and name of your personal units file.

   <p><a name="index-MYUNITSFILE-environment-variable-149"></a><a name="index-environment-variable_002c-MYUNITSFILE-150"></a>You can specify an arbitrary file as your personal units data file with
the <samp><span class="env">MYUNITSFILE</span></samp> environment variable; if this variable exists, its
value is used without searching your home directory.

A unit is specified on a single line by giving its name and an
equivalence.  Comments start with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; character, which can appear
anywhere in a line.  The backslash character (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;)
acts as a continuation
character if it appears as the last character on a line, making it
possible to spread definitions out over several lines if desired. 
A file can be included by giving the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!include</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by
the file's name.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; must be the first character on the
line.  The file will be sought in the same directory as the
parent file unless you give a full path.  The name of the file to be
included cannot contain the comment character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<a name="index-include-files-161"></a>
Unit names must not contain any of the operator characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo;,
the comment character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;, or parentheses.  They cannot begin or
end with an underscore (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;), a comma (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo;) or a decimal
point (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;).  Names cannot begin with a digit, and if a name ends
in a digit other than zero, the digit must be preceded by a string
beginning with an underscore, and afterwards consisting only of
digits, decimal points, or commas.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo_2</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo_2,1</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo_3.14</span></samp>&rsquo; would be valid names but
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo2</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo_a2</span></samp>&rsquo; would be invalid.  You could define
nitrous oxide as

<pre class="example">     N2O     nitrogen 2  + oxygen
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but would need to define nitrogen dioxide as

<pre class="example">     NO_2    nitrogen + oxygen 2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Be careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that a
reduction leads to the primitive units, which are marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;
characters.  Dimensionless units are indicated by using the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!dimensionless</span></samp>&rsquo; for the unit definition. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units_002c-defining-162"></a>
When adding new units, be sure to use the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option to check that
the new units reduce properly. 
If you create a loop in the units definitions, then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will
hang when invoked with the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option.  You will need to
use the <samp><span class="option">--check-verbose</span></samp> option, which prints out each unit as it
is checked.  The program will still hang, but the last unit printed
will be the unit that caused the infinite loop.

   <p><a name="index-parentheses-163"></a>
If you define any units that contain
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, carefully check them because the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option
will not catch non-conformable sums.  Be careful with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;
operator as well.  When used as a binary operator, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;
character can perform addition or multiplication
depending on the options used to invoke <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>. 
To ensure consistent behavior use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; only as a unary negation
operator when writing units definitions.  To multiply two units leave a
space or use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; operator with care, recalling that it has
two possible precedence values and may require parentheses to ensure
consistent behavior.  To compute the difference
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo; write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo+(-bar)</span></samp>&rsquo; or even &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo+-bar</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Here is an example of a short data file that defines some basic
units:

<pre class="example">     m       !               # The meter is a primitive unit
     sec     !               # The second is a primitive unit
     rad     !dimensionless  # A dimensionless primitive unit
     micro-  1e-6            # Define a prefix
     minute  60 sec          # A minute is 60 seconds
     hour    60 min          # An hour is 60 minutes
     inch    0.0254 m        # Inch defined in terms of meters
     ft      12 inches       # The foot defined in terms of inches
     mile    5280 ft         # And the mile
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-parentheses-164"></a>A unit that ends with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; character is a prefix.  If a prefix
definition contains any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, be sure they are protected
by parentheses.  If you define &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">half- 1/2</span></samp>&rsquo; then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">halfmeter</span></samp>&rsquo;
would be equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (2 meter)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h3 class="section">9.3 Defining Nonlinear Units</h3>

<p><a name="index-defining-nonlinear-units-165"></a><a name="index-nonlinear-units_002c-defining-166"></a><a name="index-nonlinear-unit-conversions-167"></a>Some unit conversions of interest are nonlinear; for
example, temperature conversions between the Fahrenheit and Celsius
scales cannot be done by simply multiplying by conversion factors.

   <p>When you give a linear unit definition such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inch 2.54 cm</span></samp>&rsquo; you
are providing information that <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> uses to convert values in
inches into primitive units of meters.  For nonlinear units, you give
a functional definition that provides the same information.

   <p>Nonlinear units are represented using a functional notation. 
It is best to regard this notation not as a function call but
as a way of adding units to a number, much the same way that
writing a linear unit name after a number adds units to that number. 
Internally, nonlinear units are defined by a pair of functions
that convert to and from linear units in the data file, so that
an eventual conversion to primitive units is possible.

   <p>Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:

<pre class="example">     tempF(x) units=[1;K] (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ; \
                          (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A nonlinear unit definition comprises a unit name, a dummy parameter
name, two functions, and two corresponding units.  The functions tell
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> how to convert to and from the new unit.  In order to
produce valid results, the arguments of these functions need to have
the correct dimensions.  To facilitate error checking, you may
optionally indicate units for these arguments.

   <p><a name="index-parentheses-168"></a>
The definition begins with the unit name followed immediately (with no
spaces) by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; character.  In parentheses is the name of the
parameter.  Next is an optional specification of the units required by
the functions in this definition.  In the example above, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF</span></samp>&rsquo; function requires an input argument conformable with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For normal nonlinear units definitions the forward
function will always take a dimensionless argument. 
The inverse function requires an input argument conformable
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In general the inverse function will need units
that match the quantity measured by your nonlinear unit. 
The purpose of the expression in brackets to enable
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> to perform error checking on function arguments, and
also to assign units to range and domain specifications, which are
described later.

   <p>Next the function definitions appear.  In the example above, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF</span></samp>&rsquo; function is defined by

<pre class="example">     tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This gives a rule for converting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in the units &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF</span></samp>&rsquo;
to linear units of absolute temperature, which makes it possible to
convert from tempF to other units.

   <p>In order to make conversions to Fahrenheit possible, you must give
a rule for the inverse conversions. The inverse will be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x(tempF)</span></samp>&rsquo;
and its definition appears after a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; character. 
In our example, the inverse is

<pre class="example">     x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This inverse definition takes an absolute temperature as its argument
and converts it to the Fahrenheit temperature.  The inverse can be
omitted by leaving out the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; character, but then conversions to
the unit will be impossible.  If the inverse is omitted then the
<samp><span class="option">--check</span></samp> option will display a warning.  It is up to you to
calculate and enter the correct inverse function to obtain proper
conversions.  The <samp><span class="option">--check</span></samp> option tests the inverse at one point
and prints an error if it is not valid there, but this is not a guarantee
that your inverse is correct.

   <p>If you wish to make synonyms for nonlinear units, you still need to define
both the forward and inverse functions.  Inverse functions can be
obtained using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; operator.  So to create a synonym
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tempF</span></samp>&rsquo; you could write

<pre class="example">     fahrenheit(x) units=[1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You may define a function whose range and domain do not cover all of
the real numbers.  In this case <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> can handle errors
better if you specify an appropriate range and domain.  You specify
the range and domain as shown below.

<pre class="example">     baume(d) units=[1;g/cm^3] domain=[0,130.5] range=[1,10] \
              (145/(145-d)) g/cm^3 ; (baume+-g/cm^3) 145 / baume
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example the domain is specified after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">domain=</span></samp>&rsquo; with
the endpoints given in brackets.  One of the end points can be omitted
to get an interval that goes to infinity.  So the range could be
specified as nonnegative by writing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">range=[0,]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Both the range
and domain are optional and can appear independently and in any order
along with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">units</span></samp>&rsquo; specification.  The values in the range
and domain are attached to the units given in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">units</span></samp>&rsquo;
specification.  If you don't specify the units then the parameter
inputs are reduced to primitive units for the numeric comparison to
the values you give in the range or domain.  In this case you should only
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">range</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">domain</span></samp>&rsquo; if the endpoints are zero and
infinity.

   <p>Specifying the range and domain allows <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> to
perform better error checking and give more helpful error messages
when you invoke nonlinear units conversions outside of their bounds. 
It also enables the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option to find a point in the domain
to use for its point check of your inverse definition.

   <p><a name="index-units-functions-169"></a><a name="index-functions-of-units-170"></a>You may occasionally wish to define a function that operates on units. 
This can be done using a nonlinear unit definition.  For example, the
definition below provides conversion between radius and the area of a
circle.  This definition requires a length as input and
produces an area as output, as indicated by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">units=</span></samp>&rsquo; specification. 
Specifying the range as the nonnegative numbers can prevent cryptic
error messages.

<pre class="example">     circlearea(r) units=[m;m^2] range=[0,]   pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-linear-interpolation-171"></a><a name="index-units_002c-piecewise-linear-172"></a><a name="index-piecewise-linear-units-173"></a>Sometimes you may be interested in a piecewise linear unit such as
many wire gauges.  Piecewise linear units can be defined by specifying
conversions to linear units on a list of points. 
Conversion at other points will be done by linear interpolation. 
A partial definition of zinc gauge is

<pre class="example">     zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23 0.1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zincgauge</span></samp>&rsquo; is the name of the piecewise linear
unit.  The definition of such a unit is indicated by the
embedded &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; character.  After the bracket, you should indicate the
units to be attached to the numbers in the table. 
No spaces can appear before the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; character, so a definition like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo[kg meters]</span></samp>&rsquo; is
illegal; instead write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo[kg*meters]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The definition of the
unit consists of a list of pairs optionally separated by commas. 
This list defines a function for converting from the piecewise linear
unit to linear units.  The
first item in each pair is the function argument; the second item is the
value of the function at that argument (in the units specified in brackets). 
In this example,
we define &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zincgauge</span></samp>&rsquo; at five points.  For example, we set
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zincgauge(1)</span></samp>&rsquo; equal to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.002 in</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Definitions like this
may be  more readable  if written using  continuation characters as

<pre class="example">     zincgauge[in] \
          1 0.002  \
         10 0.02   \
         15 0.04   \
         19 0.06   \
         23 0.1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">With the preceding definition, the following conversion can be
performed:

<pre class="example">     You have: zincgauge(10)
     You want: in
         * 0.02
         / 50
     You have: .01 inch
     You want: zincgauge
         5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you define a piecewise linear unit that is not strictly
monotonic, then the inverse will not be well defined.  If the inverse is
requested for such a unit, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will return the smallest
inverse.  The <samp><span class="option">--check</span></samp> option will print a warning if a
non-monotonic piecewise linear unit is encountered.

Unit list aliases are treated differently from unit definitions,
because they are a data entry shorthand rather than a true definition
for a new unit. 
A unit list alias definition begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!unitlist</span></samp>&rsquo; and includes the
alias and the definition;  for example, the aliases included in the
standard units data file are

<pre class="example">     !unitlist   hms     hr;min;sec
     !unitlist   time    year;day;hr;min;sec
     !unitlist   dms     deg;arcmin;arcsec
     !unitlist   ftin    ft;in;1|8 in
     !unitlist   usvol   cup;3|4 cup;2|3 cup;1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup;\
                         tbsp;tsp;1|2 tsp;1|4 tsp;1|8 tsp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Unit list aliases are only for unit lists, so the definition must
include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Unit list aliases can never be combined with
units or other unit list aliases, so the definition of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">time</span></samp>&rsquo;
shown above could <em>not</em> have been shortened to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">year;day;hms</span></samp>&rsquo;.  As usual, be sure to run <samp><span class="command">units --check</span></samp>
to ensure that the units listed in unit list aliases are conformable.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Numeric Output Format</h2>

<p><a name="index-numeric-output-format-177"></a><a name="index-output-format-178"></a>
By default, results of conversions are shown to eight significant
figures; this can be changed with the <samp><span class="option">--exponential</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">--output-format</span></samp> options.  The former sets an exponential
format (i.e., scientific notation) like that used in the original Unix
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program; the latter allows the format to be given as
that of the printf function in the ANSI&nbsp;C standard.

   <p>The format recognized with the <samp><span class="option">--output-format</span></samp> option is a
subset of that for printf().  Only a floating-point format of the form
<!-- noman -->
<code>%</code>[<i>flag</i>][<i>width</i>][<code>.</code><i>precision</i>]<i>type</i>
<!-- end noman -->
<!-- ifman -->
<!-- end ifman -->
is allowed: it must begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;, and must end with a
floating-point type specifier (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">E</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; for scientific
notation, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; for fixed-point decimal, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; to
specify the number of significant figures).  The format specification
may include one optional flag (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;, or a
space), followed by an optional value for the minimum field width, and
an optional precision specification that begins with a period (e.g.,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.6</span></samp>&rsquo;).  In addition to the digits, the field width includes the
decimal point, the exponent, and the sign if any of these are shown.  A
width specification is typically used with fixed-point decimal to have
columns of numbers align at the decimal point; it normally is not
useful with <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>.  Non-floating-point type specifiers make
no sense for <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>, and are forbidden.

   <p>The default format is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%.8g</span></samp>&rsquo;; for greater precision, you could
specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-o %.15g</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; formats use
exponential format whenever the exponent would be less than &minus;5,
so the value 0.000013 displays as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.3e-005</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you prefer
fixed-point display, you might specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-o %.8f</span></samp>&rsquo;; however, very
small numbers may display very few significant figures, and for very
small numbers, may show nothing but zeros.

   <p>See the documentation for printf() for more detailed descriptions of the
format specification.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Locale</h3>

<p><a name="index-locale-190"></a>A locale is a subset of a user's environment that indicates the user's
language and country, and some attendant preferences, such as the
formatting of dates.  The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program attempts to determine
the locale from the POSIX setlocale function; if this cannot be done,
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> examines the environment
variables <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>. 
On POSIX systems, a locale is of the form
<var>language</var><code>_</code><var>country</var>, where <var>language</var> is the
two-character code from ISO 639-1 and <var>country</var> is the two-character
code from ISO 3166-1; <var>language</var> is lower case and <var>country</var> is
upper case. For example, the POSIX locale for the United Kingdom is <code>en_GB</code>.

is different from that on POSIX systems; <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> attempts to map
the Windows value to a POSIX value by means of a table in the file
<samp><span class="file">locale.map</span></samp> in the same directory, typically
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/units</span></samp>, as the default units data files.  The
file includes entries for many combinations of language and country, and
can be extended to include other combinations.  The <samp><span class="file">locale.map</span></samp>
comprises two tab-separated columns; each entry is of the form

<pre class="display">     <var>Windows-locale</var>   <var>POSIX-locale</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>POSIX-locale</var> is as described above, and <var>Windows-locale</var>
typically spells out both the language and country.  For example, the
entry for the United States is

<pre class="example">     English_United States   en_US
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can force <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> to run in a desired locale by using the
<samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option.

   <p>In order to create unit definitions for a particular locale you begin
a block of definitions in a unit datafile with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!locale</span></samp>&rsquo; followed
by a locale name.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; must be the first character on the
line.  The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program reads the following
definitions only if the current locale matches.  You end the block of
localized units with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!endlocale</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Here is an example, which
defines the British gallon.

<pre class="example">     !locale en_GB
     gallon       4.54609 liter
     !endlocale

<h3 class="section">11.2 Additional Localization</h3>

<p>Sometimes the locale isn't sufficient to determine unit preferences. 
There could be regional preferences, or a company could have specific
preferences.  Though probably uncommon, such differences could arise
with the choice of English customary units outside of English-speaking
countries.  To address this, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> allows specifying
definitions that depend on environment variable settings. 
The environment variables can be controled based on the current locale,
or the user can set them to force a particular group of definitions.

   <p>A conditional block of definitions in a units data file begins with
either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!var</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!varnot</span></samp>&rsquo; following by an environment
variable name and then a space separated
list of values.  The leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; must appear in the first column of a units
data file, and the conditional block is terminated by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!endvar</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Definitions in blocks beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!var</span></samp>&rsquo; are executed only if the
environment variable is exactly equal to one of the listed values. 
Definitions in blocks beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!varnot</span></samp>&rsquo; are executed only if the
environment variable does <em>not</em> equal any of the list values.

   <p>The inch has long been a customary measure of length in many places. 
The word comes from the latin <em>uncia</em> meaning &ldquo;one twelfth,&rdquo;
referring to its relationship with the foot.  By the 20th century, the
inch was officially defined in English-speaking countries relative to
the yard, but until 1959, the yard differed slightly among those
countries.  In France the customary inch, which was displaced in 1799
by the meter, had a different length based on a french foot.  These
customary definitions could be accomodated as follows:

<pre class="example">     !var INCH_UNIT usa
     yard          3600|3937 m
     !endvar
     !var INCH_UNIT canada
     yard          0.9144 meter
     !endvar
     !var INCH_UNIT uk
     yard          0.91439841 meter
     !endvar
     !var INCH_UNIT canada uk usa
     foot          1|3 yard
     inch          1|12 foot
     !endvar
     !var INCH_UNIT france
     foot          144|443.296 m
     inch          1|12 foot
     line          1|12 inch
     !endvar
     !varnot INCH_UNIT usa uk france canada
     !message Unknown value for INCH_UNIT
     !endvar
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> reads the above definitions it will check the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">INCH_UNIT</span></samp> and load only the definitions for
the appropriate section.  If <samp><span class="env">INCH_UNIT</span></samp> is unset or is not set to
one of the four values listed then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will run the last
block.  In this case that block uses the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!message</span></samp>&rsquo; command to display a warning message.  Alternatively
that block could set default values.

   <p>In order to create default values that are overridden by user settings
the data file can use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!set</span></samp>&rsquo; command, which sets an
environment variable <em>only if it is not already set</em>;  these
settings are only for the current <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> invocation and do
not persist.  So if the example above were preceded by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!set INCH_UNIT france</span></samp>&rsquo; then this would make &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">france</span></samp>&rsquo; the
default value for <samp><span class="env">INCH_UNIT</span></samp>.  If the user had set the variable
in the environment before invoking <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>, then
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> would use the user's value.

   <p>To link these settings to the user's locale you combine the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!set</span></samp>&rsquo;
command with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!locale</span></samp>&rsquo; command. 
If you wanted to combine the above example with suitable locales you
could do by <em>preceding</em> the above definition with the following:

<pre class="example">     !locale en_US
     !set INCH_UNIT usa
     !endlocale
     !locale en_GB
     !set INCH_UNIT uk
     !endlocale
     !locale en_CA
     !set INCH_UNIT canada
     !endlocale
     !locale fr_FR
     !set INCH_UNIT france
     !endlocale
     !set INCH_UNIT france
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">These definitions set the overall default for <samp><span class="env">INCH_UNIT</span></samp> to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">france</span></samp>&rsquo; and set default values for four locales appropriately. 
The overall default setting comes last so that it only applies when
<samp><span class="env">INCH_UNIT</span></samp> was not set by one of the other commands or by the
user.

   <p>If the variable given after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!var</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!varnot</span></samp>&rsquo; is undefined
then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> prints an error message and ignores the
definitions that follow.  Use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!set</span></samp>&rsquo; to create defaults to
prevent this situation from arising.  The <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp>
option only checks the definitions that are active for the current
environment and locale, so when adding new definitions take care to
check that all cases give rise to a well defined set of definitions.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Environment Variables</h2>

<p><a name="index-environment-variables-193"></a>
The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program uses the following environment variables:

<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> to find a personal units data file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.units</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
On systems running Microsoft Windows, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> tries to
determine your home directory from the <samp><span class="env">HOMEDRIVE</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="env">HOMEPATH</span></samp> environment variables if <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> does not exist.

the pager using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+n</span></samp>&rsquo;<var>n</var> syntax for specifying a line
number.  The default pager is <samp><span class="command">more</span></samp>; <samp><span class="env">PAGER</span></samp> can be used
to specify alternatives such as <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">pg</span></samp>,

The standard units data file is written in Unicode using the UTF-8 encoding. 
Portions of the file that are not plain ASCII begin with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!utf8</span></samp>&rsquo; and end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!endutf8</span></samp>&rsquo;.  As usual, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; must
appear as the first character on the line.  If a line of a data file
contains byte sequences that are invalid UTF-8 or non-printing UTF-8
then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> ignores the entire line.

   <p>When <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> runs it checks the locale to determine the
character set.  If UTF-8 is listed, then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp>
reads the utf8 definitions.  If any other character set is in use, then
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> works in plain ASCII without support for extended
characters.

<h2 class="chapter">15 Updating Currency Exchange Rates</h2>

<p><a name="index-currency_002c-updating-220"></a><a name="index-exchange-rates_002c-updating-221"></a>
The units program includes currency exchange rates and prices for some
precious metals in the database.  Of course, these values change over
time, sometimes very rapidly, and <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> cannot provide real
time values.  To update the exchange rates run the
<samp><span class="command">units_cur</span></samp>, which rewrites the files containing the currency
rates, typically <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/units/currency.units</span></samp>.  This program
must be run with suitable permissions to write the file.  To keep the
rates updated automatically, it could be run by a cron job on a
Unix-like system, or a similar scheduling program on a different system. 
Currency exchange rates are taken from Time Genie
(<a href="http://www.timegenie.com">http://www.timegenie.com</a>) and precious metals pricing from
Packetizer (<a href="www.packetizer.com">www.packetizer.com</a>).  These sites update once per
day, so there is no benefit in running the update script more often than
daily.  You can run <samp><span class="command">units_cur</span></samp> with a filename specified on the
command line and it will write the data to that file.  If you give
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; for the file it will write to standard output.
