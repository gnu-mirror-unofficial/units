<h2 class="chapter">4 Unit Definitions</h2>

<p><a name="index-unit-definitions-14"></a>
The conversion information is read from a units data file that
is called <samp><span class="file">definitions.units</span></samp> and is usually located in
the <samp><span class="file">/usr/share/units</span></samp> directory. 
If you invoke <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> with the <samp><span class="option">-V</span></samp> option, it will print
the location of this file. 
The default
file includes definitions for all familiar units, abbreviations and
metric prefixes.  It also includes many obscure or archaic units.

   <p>Many constants of nature are defined, including these:

<pre class="example">     pi          <span class="roman">ratio of circumference to diameter</span>
     c           <span class="roman">speed of light</span>
     e           <span class="roman">charge on an electron</span>
     force       <span class="roman">acceleration of gravity</span>
     mole        <span class="roman">Avogadro's number</span>
     water       <span class="roman">pressure per unit height of water</span>
     Hg          <span class="roman">pressure per unit height of mercury</span>
     au          <span class="roman">astronomical unit</span>
     k           <span class="roman">Boltzman's constant</span>
     mu0         <span class="roman">permeability of vacuum</span>
     epsilon0    <span class="roman">permittivity of vacuum</span>
     G           <span class="roman">Gravitational constant</span>
     mach        <span class="roman">speed of sound</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The standard data file includes atomic masses for all of the elements
and numerous other constants.  Also included are the densities of
various ingredients used in baking so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2&nbsp;cups flour_sifted</span></samp>&rsquo;
can be converted to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">grams</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is not an exhaustive list. 
Consult the units data file to see the complete list, or to see the
definitions that are used.

   <p><a name="index-measure_002c-Imperial-15"></a><a name="index-Imperial-measure-16"></a><a name="index-British-Imperial-measure-17"></a>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pound</span></samp>&rsquo; is a unit of mass.  To get force, multiply by the
force conversion unit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">force</span></samp>&rsquo; or use the shorthand &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lbf</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; is already taken as the standard abbreviation for
the gram.)  The unit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ounce</span></samp>&rsquo; is also a unit of mass.  The fluid
ounce is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fluidounce</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">floz</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When British capacity
units differ from their US counterparts, such as the British Imperial
gallon, the unit is defined both ways with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">br</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">us</span></samp>&rsquo;
prefixes.  Your locale settings will determine the value of the
unprefixed unit.  Currency is prefixed with its country
name: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">belgiumfranc</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">britainpound</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-units_002c-lookup-method-18"></a>
When searching for a unit, if the specified string does not appear
exactly as a unit name, then the <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program will try to
remove a trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">es</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Next units will replace a
trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ies</span></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If that fails,
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will check for a prefix.  The database includes all
of the standard metric prefixes.  Only one prefix is permitted per
unit, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">micromicrofarad</span></samp>&rsquo; will fail.  However, prefixes can
appear alone with no unit following them, so
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">micro*microfarad</span></samp>&rsquo; will work, as will &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">micro microfarad</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-prefixes-19"></a>
To find out which units and prefixes are available, read the standard
units data file, which is extensively annotated.

<h3 class="section">4.1 English Customary Units</h3>

<p><a name="index-volume-measure_002c-English-customary-20"></a>English customary units differ in various ways in different
regions.  In Britain a complex system of volume measurements featured
different gallons for different materials such as a wine gallon and
ale gallon that different by twenty percent.  This complexity was
swept away in 1824 by a reform that created an entirely new gallon,
the British Imperial gallon defined as the volume occupied by ten
pounds of water.  Meanwhile in the USA the gallon is derived from the
1707 Winchester wine gallon, which is 231 cubic inches.  These gallons
differ by about twenty percent.  By default if <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> runs in
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB</span></samp>&rsquo; locale you will get the British volume measures.  If
it runs in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_US</span></samp>&rsquo; locale you will get the US volume
measures.  In other locales the default values are the US
definitions.  If you wish to force different definitions then set the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">UNITS_ENGLISH</span></samp> to either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">US</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GB</span></samp>&rsquo; to set the desired definitions independent of the locale.

   <p><a name="index-length-measure_002c-English-customary-21"></a><a name="index-length-measure_002c-UK-22"></a><a name="index-survey-measure_002c-US-23"></a><a name="index-US-survey-measure-24"></a><a name="index-survey-mile_002c-US-25"></a><a name="index-US-survey-foot-26"></a><a name="index-State-Plane-Coordinate-System_002c-US-27"></a><a name="index-US-State-Plane-Coordinate-System-28"></a><a name="index-survey-foot_002c-US-29"></a><a name="index-US-survey-mile-30"></a><a name="index-mile_002c-international-31"></a><a name="index-international-mile-32"></a><a name="index-yard_002c-international-33"></a><a name="index-international-yard-34"></a>Before 1959, the value of a yard (and other units of measure defined in
terms of it) differed slightly among English-speaking countries.  In
1959, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United
States, and South Africa adopted the Canadian value of 1&nbsp;yard =
0.9144&nbsp;m (exactly), which was approximately halfway between the
values used by the UK and the US; it had the additional advantage of
making 1&nbsp;inch = 2.54&nbsp;cm (exactly).  This new standard was
termed the <dfn>International Yard</dfn>.  Australia, Canada, and the UK then
defined all customary lengths in terms of the International Yard
(Australia did not define the furlong or rod); because many US land
surveys were in terms of the pre-1959 units, the US continued to define
customary surveyors' units (furlong, chain, rod, and link) in terms of
the previous value for the foot, which was termed the
<dfn>US survey foot</dfn>.  The US defined a <dfn>US survey mile</dfn> as 5280 US
survey feet, and defined a <dfn>statute mile</dfn> as a US survey mile.  The
US values for these units differ from the international values by about
2&nbsp;ppm.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program uses the international values for these
units; the US values can be obtained by using either the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">US</span></samp>&rsquo; or
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">survey</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix.  In either case, the simple familiar
relationships among the units are maintained, e.g., 1 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">furlong</span></samp>&rsquo; =
660 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ft</span></samp>&rsquo;, and 1 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USfurlong</span></samp>&rsquo; = 660 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USft</span></samp>&rsquo;, though the
metric equivalents differ slightly between the two cases. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">US</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">survey</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix can also be used to
obtain the US survey mile and the value of the US yard prior to 1959,
e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USmile</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">surveymile</span></samp>&rsquo; (but <em>not</em>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USsurveymile</span></samp>&rsquo;).  To get the US value of the statute mile, use
either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USstatutemile</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USmile</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Except for distances that extend over hundreds of miles (such as in the
US State Plane Coordinate System), the differences in the miles are
usually insignificant:

<pre class="example">     You have: 100 surveymile - 100 mile
     You want: inch
             * 12.672025
             / 0.078913984
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The pre-1959 UK values for these units can be obtained with the prefix
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">UK</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>In the US, the acre is officially defined in terms of the US survey
foot, but <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> uses a definition based on the international
foot.  If you want the official US acre use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USacre</span></samp>&rsquo; and
similarly use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USacrefoot</span></samp>&rsquo; for the official US version of that
unit.  The difference between these units is about 4 parts per million.
