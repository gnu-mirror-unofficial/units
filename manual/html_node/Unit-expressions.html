<h2 class="chapter">4 Unit expressions</h2>

<p><a name="index-unit-expressions-11"></a>
In order to enter more complicated units or fractions,
you will need to use operations such as powers, products and division. 
Powers of units can be specified using the <span class="samp">^</span> character as shown in
the following example, or by simple concatenation: <span class="samp">cm3</span> is equivalent to
<span class="samp">cm^3</span>. 
If the exponent is more than one digit, the <span class="samp">^</span> is required.  An
exponent like <span class="samp">2^3^2</span> is evaluated right to left.  The <span class="samp">^</span>
operator has the second highest precedence. 
<a name="index-powers-12"></a><a name="index-products-13"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: cm^3
         You want: gallons
                 * 0.00026417205
                 / 3785.4118
     
         You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force
         You want: ft lbf
                 * 0.7296
                 / 1.370614
</pre>
   <p>Multiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, or an asterisk
(<span class="samp">*</span>).  If <code>units</code> is invoked with the <span class="samp">--product</span>
option then the hyphen (<span class="samp">-</span>) also acts as a multiplication
operator.  Division of units is indicated
by the slash (<span class="samp">/</span>) or by <span class="samp">per</span>. 
<a name="index-multiplication-of-units-14"></a><a name="index-division-of-units-15"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: furlongs per fortnight
         You want: m/s
                 * 0.00016630986
                 / 6012.8727
</pre>
   <p>Multiplication has a higher precedence than division and is evaluated
left to right, so
<span class="samp">m/s * s/day</span> is equivalent to <span class="samp">m / s s day</span> and has dimensions of
length per time cubed.  Similarly, <span class="samp">1/2 meter</span> refers to a unit of reciprocal length
equivalent to .5/meter, which is
probably not what you would intend if you entered that expression. 
You can indicate division of numbers
with the vertical dash (<span class="samp">|</span>).  This operator has the highest
precedence so the square root of two thirds could be written <span class="samp">2|3^1|2</span>. 
<a name="index-fractions-16"></a><a name="index-division-of-numbers-17"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: 1|2 inch
         You want: cm
                 * 1.27
                 / 0.78740157
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Parentheses can be used for grouping as desired.

<pre class="example">         You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter)
         You want: league
                 * 0.00010356166
                 / 9656.0833
</pre>
   <p>Prefixes are defined separately from base units.  In order to get
centimeters, the units database defines <span class="samp">centi-</span> and <span class="samp">c-</span> as
prefixes.  Prefixes can appear alone with no unit following them. 
An exponent applies only to the immediately preceding unit and its
prefix so that <span class="samp">cm^3</span> or <span class="samp">centimeter^3</span> refer to cubic centimeters
but <span class="samp">centi*meter^3</span> refers to hundredths of cubic meters.  Only one
prefix is permitted per unit, so <span class="samp">micromicrofarad</span> will fail, but
<span class="samp">micro*microfarad</span> will work, as will <span class="samp">micro microfarad</span>..

   <p>For <code>units</code>, numbers are just another kind of unit.  They can
appear as many times as you like and in any order in a unit expression. 
For example, to find the volume of a box which is 2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft
in steres, you could do the following:

<pre class="example">         You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft
         You want: stere
                 * 2.038813
                 / 0.49048148
     
         You have: $ 5 / yard
         You want: cents / inch
                 * 13.888889
                 / 0.072
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And the second example shows how the dollar sign in the units conversion
can precede the five.  Be careful:  <code>units</code> will interpret
<span class="samp">$5</span> with no space as equivalent to dollars^5.

   <p>Outside of the SI system, it is often desirable to add values of
different units together.  You may also wish to use <code>units</code> as a
calculator that keeps track of units.  Sums of conformable units are written with
the <span class="samp">+</span> character. 
<a name="index-sums-of-units-18"></a><a name="index-addition-of-units-19"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds
         You want: seconds
                 * 8612
                 / 0.00011611705
     
         You have: 12 ft + 3 in
         You want: cm
                 * 373.38
                 / 0.0026782366
     
         You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf
         You want: btu
                 * 2.5782804
                 / 0.38785542
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The expressions which are added together must reduce to identical
expressions in primitive units, or an error message will be displayed:

<pre class="example">         You have: 12 printerspoint + 4 heredium
                                               ^
         Illegal sum of non-conformable units
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Historically <span class="samp">-</span> has been used for products of units, which complicates
its iterpretation in <code>units</code>.  Because <code>units</code> provides
several other ways to obtain unit products, and because <span class="samp">-</span> is a
subtraction operator in general algebraic expressions, <code>units</code>
treats the binary <span class="samp">-</span> as a subtraction operator by default.  This
behavior can be altered using the <span class="samp">--product</span> option which
causes <code>units</code> to treat the binary <span class="samp">-</span> operator as a product
operator.  Note that when <span class="samp">-</span> is a multiplication operator it has
the same precedence as <span class="samp">*</span>, but when <span class="samp">-</span> is a subtraction operator
it has the lower precedence as the addition operator.

   <p>When <span class="samp">-</span> is used as a unary operator it negates its operand. 
Regardless of the <code>units</code> options, if
<span class="samp">-</span> appears after <span class="samp">(</span> or after
<span class="samp">+</span> then it will act as a negation operator.  So you can always compute 20
degrees minus 12 minutes by entering <span class="samp">20 degrees + -12 arcmin</span>. 
You must use this construction when you define new units because you
cannot know what options will be in force when your definition is
processed.

   <p>The <span class="samp">+</span> character sometimes appears in exponents like
<span class="samp">3.43e+8</span>.  This leads to an ambiguity in an expression like
<span class="samp">3e+2 yC</span>.  The unit <span class="samp">e</span> is a small unit of charge, so this
can be regarded as equivalent to <span class="samp">(3e+2) yC</span> or <span class="samp">(3 e)+(2 yC)</span>. 
This ambiguity is resolved by always interpreting <span class="samp">+</span> as part
of an exponent if possible.

   <p><a name="index-functions_002c-built-in-20"></a>Several built in functions are provided: <span class="samp">sin</span>, <span class="samp">cos</span>,
<span class="samp">tan</span>, <span class="samp">ln</span>, <span class="samp">log</span>, <span class="samp">log2</span>, <span class="samp">exp</span>, <span class="samp">acos</span>,
<span class="samp">atan</span> and <span class="samp">asin</span>.  The <span class="samp">sin</span>, <span class="samp">cos</span>, and <span class="samp">tan</span>
functions require either a dimensionless argument or an argument with
dimensions of angle.

<pre class="example">         You have: sin(30 degrees)
         You want:
                 Definition: 0.5
     
         You have: sin(pi/2)
         You want:
                 Definition: 1
     
         You have: sin(3 kg)
                           ^
         Unit not dimensionless
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The other functions on the list require dimensionless arguments.  The
inverse trigonometric functions return arguments with dimensions of
angle.

   <p><a name="index-roots-21"></a><a name="index-square-roots-22"></a>If you wish to take roots of units, you may use the <span class="samp">sqrt</span> or
<span class="samp">cuberoot</span> functions.  These functions require that the argument
have the appropriate root.  Higher roots can  be obtained by using
fractional exponents:

<pre class="example">         You have: sqrt(acre)
         You want: feet
                 * 208.71074
                 / 0.0047913202
     
         You have: (400 W/m^2 / stefanboltzmann)^(1/4)
         You have:
                 Definition: 289.80882 K
     
         You have: cuberoot(hectare)
                                   ^
         Unit not a root
</pre>
   <h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Temperature Conversion Example</h5>

<p><a name="index-temperature-conversions-23"></a><a name="Temperature-Conversion-Example"></a>
Nonlinear units are represented using functional notation.  They make
possible nonlinear unit conversions such temperature.  This is different
from the linear units that convert temperature differences.  Note the
difference below.  The absolute temperature conversions are handled by
units starting with <span class="samp">temp</span>, and you must use functional notation. 
The temperature differences are done using units starting with
<span class="samp">deg</span> and they do not require functional notation.

<pre class="example">         You have: tempF(45)
         You want: tempC
                 7.2222222
     
         You have: 45 degF
         You want: degC
                 * 25
                 / 0.04
</pre>
   <p>Think of <span class="samp">tempF(x)</span> not as a function but as a notation which
indicates that <span class="samp">x</span> should have units of <span class="samp">tempF</span> attached to
it.  See <a href="Nonlinear-units.html#Nonlinear-units">Nonlinear units</a>.  The first conversion shows that if it's 45
degrees Fahrehneit outside it's 7.2 degrees Celsius.  The second
conversions indicates that a change of 45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds
to a change of 25 degrees Celsius.

   <p>Some other examples of nonlinears units are ring size and wire gauge. 
There are numerous different gauges and ring sizes.  See the units
database for more details.  Note that wire gauges
with multiple zeroes are signified using negative numbers where two
zeroes is -1.  Alternatively, you can use the synonyms <span class="samp">g00</span>,
<span class="samp">g000</span>, and so on that are defined in the units database.

<pre class="example">         You have: wiregauge(11)
         You want: inches
                 * 0.090742002
                 / 11.020255
     
         You have: brwiregauge(g00)
         You want: inches
                 * 0.348
                 / 2.8735632
     
         You have: 1 mm
         You want: wiregauge
