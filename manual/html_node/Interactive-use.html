<h2 class="chapter">2 Interacting with <code>units</code></h2>

<p><a name="index-interactive-use-1"></a>
To invoke units for interactive use, type <kbd>units</kbd> at your shell
prompt.  The program will print something like this:

<pre class="example">         2131 units, 53 prefixes, 24 nonlinear units
     
         You have:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the <span class="samp">You have:</span> prompt, type the quantity and units that
you are converting <em>from</em>.  For example, if you want to convert ten
meters to feet, type <kbd>10 meters</kbd>.  Next, <code>units</code> will print
<span class="samp">You want:</span>.  You should type the type of units you want to convert
<em>to</em>.  To convert to feet, you would type <kbd>feet</kbd>.  Note that if
the readline library was compiled in then the tab key can be used to
complete unit names.  See <a href="Readline-support.html#Readline-support">Readline support</a>, for more information
about readline.

   <p>The answer will be displayed in two ways.  The first line of output,
which is marked with a <span class="samp">*</span> to indicate multiplication,
gives the result of the conversion you have asked for.  The second line
of output, which is marked with a <span class="samp">/</span> to indicate division, gives
the inverse of the conversion factor.  If you convert 10 meters to feet,
<code>units</code> will print

<pre class="example">             * 32.808399
             / 0.03048
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet. 
The second number gives the conversion in the opposite direction. 
In this case, it tells you that 1 foot is equal to about
0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10 meters. 
It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about .03.

   <p>The <code>units</code> program prints the inverse because sometimes it is a
more convenient number.  In the example above, for example, the inverse
value is an exact conversion: a foot is exactly .03048 dekameters. 
But the number given the other direction is inexact.

   <p>If you try to convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:

<pre class="example">         You have: grains
         You want: pounds
                 * 0.00014285714
                 / 7000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">From the second line of the output you can immediately see that a grain
is equal to a seven thousandth of a pound.  This is not so obvious from
the first line of the output. 
If you find  the output format  confusing, try using the
<span class="samp">--verbose</span> option:
<a name="index-verbose-output-2"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: grain
         You want: aeginamina
                 grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
                 grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina
</pre>
   <p>If you request a conversion between units which measure reciprocal
dimensions, then <code>units</code> will display the conversion results with an extra
note indicating that reciprocal conversion has been done:
<a name="index-reciprocal-conversion-3"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: 6 ohms
         You want: siemens
                 reciprocal conversion
                 * 0.16666667
                 / 6
</pre>
   <p>Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the <span class="samp">--strict</span> option. 
As usual, use
the <span class="samp">--verbose</span> option to get more comprehensible output:
<a name="index-verbose-output-4"></a><a name="index-strict-conversion-5"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: tex
         You want: typp
                 reciprocal conversion
                 1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
                 1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
     
         You have: 20 mph
         You want: sec/mile
                 reciprocal conversion
                 1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
                 1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile
</pre>
   <p>If you enter incompatible unit types, the <code>units</code> program will
print a message indicating that the units are not conformable and
it will display the reduced form for each unit:
<a name="index-incompatible-units-6"></a><a name="index-non_002dconformable-units-7"></a>
<pre class="example">         You have: ergs/hour
         You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
         conformability error
                 2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
                 2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
</pre>
   <p>If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit,
simply press return at the <span class="samp">You want:</span> prompt.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">         You have: jansky
         You want:
                 Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output from <code>units</code> indicates that the jansky is defined to be
equal to a fluxunit which in turn is defined to be a certain combination
of watts, meters, and hertz.  The fully reduced (and in this case
somewhat more cryptic) form appears on the far right.

   <p>Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some situations. 
These include the radian and steradian.  These units will be treated
as equal to 1 in units conversions.  Power is equal to torque times
angular velocity.  This conversion can only be performed if the radian
is dimensionless.

<pre class="example">         You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
         You want: watts
                 * 227.77742
                 / 0.0043902509
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that named dimensionaless units are not treated as dimensionless
in other contexts.  They cannot be used as exponents
so for example, <span class="samp">meter^radian</span> is not allowed. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units-8"></a>
If you want a list of options you can type <kbd>?</kbd> at the
<span class="samp">You want:</span> prompt.  The program will display a list of named
units which are conformable with the unit that you entered at
the <span class="samp">You have:</span> prompt above.  Note that conformable unit
combinations will not appear on this list.

   <p>Typing <kbd>help</kbd> at either prompt displays a short help message. 
You can also type <kbd>help</kbd> followed by a unit name.  This will
invoke a pager on the units data base at the point where that unit
is defined.  You can read the definition and comments that may
give more details or historical information about the unit.
