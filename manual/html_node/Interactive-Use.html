<h2 class="chapter">2 Interacting with <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp></h2>

<p><a name="index-interactive-use-1"></a>
To invoke units for interactive use, type <kbd>units</kbd> at your shell
prompt.  The program will print something like this:

<pre class="example">     Currency exchange rates from 04/23/12
     2516 units, 85 prefixes, 65 nonlinear units
     
     You have:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You have:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt, type the quantity and units that
you are converting <em>from</em>.  For example, if you want to convert ten
meters to feet, type <kbd>10 meters</kbd>.  Next, <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will print
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You should type the units you want to convert
<em>to</em>.  To convert to feet, you would type <kbd>feet</kbd>.  If
the <samp><span class="command">readline</span></samp> library was compiled in then the tab key can be
used to complete unit names. See <a href="Readline-Support.html#Readline-Support">Readline Support</a>, for more
information about <samp><span class="command">readline</span></samp>.  To quit the program press
Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D under Unix.  Under Windows press Ctrl-Z.

   <p>The answer will be displayed in two ways.  The first line of output,
which is marked with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate multiplication,
gives the result of the conversion you have asked for.  The second line
of output, which is marked with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate division, gives
the inverse of the conversion factor.  If you convert 10 meters to feet,
<samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will print

<pre class="example">         * 32.808399
         / 0.03048
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet. 
The second number gives the conversion in the opposite direction. 
In this case, it tells you that 1 foot is equal to about
0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10 meters. 
It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about 0.03.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program prints the inverse because sometimes it is a
more convenient number.  In the example above, for example, the inverse
value is an exact conversion: a foot is exactly 0.03048 dekameters. 
But the number given the other direction is inexact.

   <p>If you convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:

<pre class="example">     You have: grains
     You want: pounds
             * 0.00014285714
             / 7000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">From the second line of the output you can immediately see that a grain
is equal to a seven thousandth of a pound.  This is not so obvious from
the first line of the output. 
If you find  the output format  confusing, try using the
<samp><span class="option">--verbose</span></samp> option:
<a name="index-verbose-output-2"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: grain
     You want: aeginamina
             grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
             grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you request a conversion between units that measure reciprocal
dimensions, then <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> will display the conversion results with an extra
note indicating that reciprocal conversion has been done:
<a name="index-reciprocal-conversion-3"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: 6 ohms
     You want: siemens
             reciprocal conversion
             * 0.16666667
             / 6
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the <samp><span class="option">--strict</span></samp> option. 
As usual, use
the <samp><span class="option">--verbose</span></samp> option to get more comprehensible output:
<a name="index-verbose-output-4"></a><a name="index-strict-conversion-5"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: tex
     You want: typp
             reciprocal conversion
             1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
             1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
     
     You have: 20 mph
     You want: sec/mile
             reciprocal conversion
             1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
             1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you enter incompatible unit types, the <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> program will
print a message indicating that the units are not conformable and
it will display the reduced form for each unit:
<a name="index-incompatible-units-6"></a><a name="index-non_002dconformable-units-7"></a>
<pre class="example">     You have: ergs/hour
     You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
     conformability error
             2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
             2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit,
simply press &lt;Enter&gt; at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     You have: jansky
     You want:
             Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output from <samp><span class="command">units</span></samp> indicates that the jansky is defined to be
equal to a fluxunit which in turn is defined to be a certain combination
of watts, meters, and hertz.  The fully reduced (and in this case
somewhat more cryptic) form appears on the far right.

   <p>Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some situations. 
These units include the radian and steradian.  These units will be
treated as equal to 1 in units conversions.  Power is equal to torque
times angular velocity.  This conversion can only be performed if the
radian is dimensionless.

<pre class="example">     You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
     You want: watts
             * 227.77742
             / 0.0043902509
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Named dimensionless units are not treated as dimensionless
in other contexts.  They cannot be used as exponents
so for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">meter^radian</span></samp>&rsquo; is not allowed. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units-8"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-to-show-conformable-units-9"></a><a name="index-conformable-units_002c-_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-to-show-10"></a>If you want a list of options you can type <kbd>?</kbd> at the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You want:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt.  The program will display a list of named
units that are conformable with the unit that you entered at
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">You have:</span></samp>&rsquo; prompt above.  Conformable unit
<em>combinations</em> will not appear on this list.

   <p><a name="index-help-11"></a>
Typing <kbd>help</kbd> at either prompt displays a short help message. 
You can also type <kbd>help</kbd> followed by a unit name.  This will
invoke a pager on the units data base at the point where that unit
is defined.  You can read the definition and comments that may
give more details or historical information about the unit.  (You
can generally quit out of the page by pressing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>Typing <kbd>search</kbd> <var>text</var> will display a list of all of the units
whose names contain <var>text</var> as a substring along with their definitions. 
This may help in the case where you aren't sure of the right unit name.
