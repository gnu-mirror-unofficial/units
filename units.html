<h2>GNU Units</h2>

<p>GNU Units converts quantities expressed in various
systems of measurement to their equivalents in other systems of
measurement.  Like many similar programs, it can handle multiplicative
scale changes. It can also handle nonlinear conversions such as
Fahrenheit to Celsius or wire gauge, and it can convert from and to sums of
units, such as converting between meters and feet plus inches.  </p>

<p>
Beyond simple unit conversions, GNU Units can be used as a
general-purpose scientific calculator that keeps track of units in its
calculations.  You can form arbitrary complex mathematical expressions
of dimensions including sums, products, quotients, powers, and even roots
of dimensions.  Thus you can ensure accuracy and dimensional consistency
when working with long expressions that involve many different units
that may combine in complex ways.  </p>

<p>
The units are defined in an external data file.  You can use the
extensive data file that comes with this program, or you can 
provide your own data file to suit your needs.  You can also use your
own data file to supplement the standard data file.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>


<p>
Two simple conversion examples:
</p>
<pre class="emph-box">
You have: mile
You want: km
        * 1.609344
        / 0.62137119

You have: furlongs per fortnight
You want: m/s  
        * 0.00016630986
        / 6012.8727
</pre>

<p>
A calculation involving roots of units:
</p>
<pre class="emph-box">
You have: (400 W/m^2 / stefanboltzmann)^(1/4)
You have:
        Definition: 289.80882 K
</pre>


<p>
Temperature <em>differences</em> are converted using the syntax
shown above with unit names like degC and degF.  But conversion of
absolute temperatures requires a different syntax:
</p>
<pre class="emph-box">
You have: tempF(45)
You want: tempC
        7.2222222
</pre>

<p>
Converting from a sum of units:
</p>
<pre class="emph-box">
You have: 17 yards + 2 feet + 5 inches
You want: meter
        * 16.2814
        / 0.06141978
</pre>

<p>
Converting to a sum of units such as hours plus minutes or feet plus inches:
</p>
<pre class="emph-box">
You have: 7 meters
You want: ft;in
        22 ft + 11.590551 in
</pre>

<p>
Converting a sixth of a (US) cup to common US measures:
</p>
<pre class="emph-box">
You have: 1|6 cup
You want: usvol
        2 tbsp + 2 tsp
</pre>
